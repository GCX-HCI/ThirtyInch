# ThirtyInch - a MVP library for Android


This library adds Presenters to Activities and Fragments. It favors the stateful Presenter pattern, where the Presenter survives configuration changes and dumb View pattern, where the View only sends user events and receives information from the Presenter but never actively asks for data. This makes testing very easy because no logic lives in the View (Activity, Fragment) except for fancy animations which anyways aren't testable.

#### The name

> Keep Android At Armâ€™s Length
>
&mdash; Kevin Schultz, Droidcon NYC '14

The perfect distance to the Android Framework is approximately **thirty inches**, the average length of the human arm, shoulder to fingertips.

## Get it [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/passsy/maven/ThirtyInch/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/passsy/maven/ThirtyInch/_latestVersion)

ThirtyInch is available via [jcenter](https://blog.bintray.com/2015/02/09/android-studio-migration-from-maven-central-to-jcenter/)

```gradle
dependencies {
    def thirtyinchVersion = '0.8.5'
    
    // MVP for activity and fragment
    compile "net.grandcentrix.thirtyinch:thirtyinch:$thirtyinchVersion"
    // We only provid AppCompat so you have to include it by yourself
    compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:$appCompatVersion"
    
    // rx (1 or 2) extension
    compile "net.grandcentrix.thirtyinch:thirtyinch-rx:$thirtyinchVersion"
    compile "net.grandcentrix.thirtyinch:thirtyinch-rx2:$thirtyinchVersion"
    
    compile "net.grandcentrix.thirtyinch:thirtyinch-logginginterceptor:$thirtyinchVersion"
     
    // CompositeAndroid plugin
    // When you are using ThirtyInch with the CompositeAndroid extension you have to manually 
    // include the CompositeAndroid dependency. It has to be the same version as appcompat and 
    // the support library 
    
    compile "net.grandcentrix.thirtyinch:thirtyinch-plugin:$thirtyinchVersion"
    // def supportLibraryVersion = '24.2.1' <-- use your own version
    compile "com.pascalwelsch.compositeandroid:activity:$supportLibraryVersion"
}
```


## [ThirtyInch sample project](https://github.com/passsy/thirtyinch-sample) (work in progress)

There is a sample implementation based on the [Android Architecture Blueprints TODO app](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture) which can be found here: [ThirtyInch sample project](https://github.com/passsy/thirtyinch-sample) (work in progress)

## Hello World MVP example with ThirtyInch

`HelloWorldActivity.java`
```java
public class HelloWorldActivity 
        extends TiActivity<HelloWorldPresenter, HelloWorldView> 
        implements HelloWorldView {

    private TextView mOutput;

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public HelloWorldPresenter providePresenter() {
        return new HelloWorldPresenter();
    }

    @Override
    public void showText(final String text) {
        mOutput.setText(text);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_hello_world);

        mOutput = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.output);
    }
}
```

`HelloWorldView.java`
```java
public interface HelloWorldView extends TiView {

    @CallOnMainThread
    void showText(final String text);
}

```

`HelloWorldPresenter.java`
```java
public class HelloWorldPresenter extends TiPresenter<HelloWorldView> {

    @Override    
    protected void onAttachView(@NonNull final HelloWorldView view) {
        super.onAttachView(view);
        view.showText("Hello World!");
    }
}

```
## ThirtyInch features

### Presenter

- survives configuration changes
- survives when the `Activity` got killed in background
- is not a singleton
- dies when the `Activity` gets finished

#### Lifecycle

The `TiPresenter` lifecycle is very easy.

It can be `CREATED` and `DESTROYED`. 
The corresponding callbacks `onCreate()` and `onDestroy()` will be only called once!

The `TiView` can either be `ATTACHED` or `DETACHED`.
The corresponding callbacks are `onAttachView(TiView)` and `onDetachView()` which maps to `onStart()` and `onStop()`.


```java
public class MyPresenter extends TiPresenter<MyView> {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onAttachView(@NonNull final HelloWorldView view) {
        super.onAttachView(view);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDetachView() {
        super.onDetachView();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
    }
}

```

The lifecycle can be observed using `TiLifecycleObserver`

There is no callback for `onResume()` and `onPause()` in the `TiPresenter`. 
This is something the view layer should handle.

##### Configuration

The default behaviour might not fit your needs. 
You can disable unwanted features by providing a configuration in the `TiPresenter` constructor.

```java
public class HelloWorldPresenter extends TiPresenter<HelloWorldView> {

    public static final TiConfiguration PRESENTER_CONFIG = 
            new TiConfiguration.Builder()
                .setRetainPresenterEnabled(true) 
                .setCallOnMainThreadInterceptorEnabled(true)
                .setDistinctUntilChangedInterceptorEnabled(true)
                .build();
            
    public HelloWorldPresenter() {
        super(PRESENTER_CONFIG);
    }
}
```

Or globally for all `TiPresenters`
```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        TiPresenter.setDefaultConfig(MY_DEFAULT_CONFIG);
    }
}
```

### TiView Annotations

Two awesome annotations for the `TiView` interface made it already into `Ti` saving you a lot of time.

```java
public interface HelloWorldView extends TiView {

    @CallOnMainThread
    @DistinctUntilChanged
    void showText(final String text);
}
```

##### @CallOnMainThread

Whenever you call this method it will be called on the Android main thread.
This allows to run code off the main thread but send events to the UI without dealing with Handlers and Loopers.

Requires to be a `void` method. Works only for `TiView` interfaces implemented by "Android Views" (`TiActivity`, `TiFragment`).

Enabled by default, can be disabled with the `TiConfiguration`

##### @DistinctUntilChanged

When calling this method the `View` receives no duplicated calls.
The View swallows the second call when a method gets called with the same (hashcode) parameters twice.

Usecase:
The Presenter binds a huge list to the `View`. The app loses focus (`onDetachView()`) and the exact same Activity instance gains focus again (`onAttachView(view)`).
The `Activity` still shows the huge list.
The `Presenter` binds the huge list again to the `View`.
When the data has changed the list will be updated.
When the data hasn't changed the call gets swallowed and prevents flickering.

Requires to be a `void` method and has at least one parameter.

Enabled by default, can be disabled with the `TiConfiguration`


### View binding interceptors

*View Annotations* only work because ThirtyInch supports interceptors. 
Add interceptors (`BindViewInterceptor`) to `TiActivity` or `TiFragment` to intercept the binding process from `TiView` to `TiPresenter`.
Interceptors are public API waiting for other great ideas.


```java
public class HelloWorldActivity extends TiActivity<HelloWorldPresenter, HelloWorldView>
        implements HelloWorldView {

    public HelloWorldActivity() {
        addBindViewInterceptor(new LoggingInterceptor());
    }
}
```

`LoggingInterceptor` is available as module and logs all calls to the view.

### [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)

Using RxJava for networking is very often used.
Observing a `Model` is another good usecase where Rx can be used inside of a `TiPresenter`.
The Rx package provides helper classes to deal with `Subscription` or wait for an attached `TiView`.

```java
public class HelloWorldPresenter extends TiPresenter<HelloWorldView> {

    // add the subscription helper to your presenter
    private RxTiPresenterSubscriptionHandler rxHelper = new RxTiPresenterSubscriptionHandler(this);

    @Override
    protected void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        
        // automatically unsubscribe in onDestroy()
        rxHelper.manageSubscription(
                Observable.interval(0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                    // cache the latest value when no view is attached
                    // emits when the view got attached
                    .compose(RxTiPresenterUtils.<Long>deliverLatestToView(this))
                    .subscribe(uptime -> getView().showPresenterUpTime(uptime))
        );
    }

    @Override
    protected void onAttachView(@NonNull final HelloWorldView view) {
        super.onAttachView(view);
        
        // automatically unsubscribe in onDetachView(view)
        rxHelper.manageViewSubscription(anotherObservable.subscribe());
    }
}
```

### [CompositeAndroid](https://github.com/passsy/CompositeAndroid)

Extending `TiActivity` is probably not what you want because you already have a `BaseActivity`.
Extending all already existing Activities from `TiActivity` doesn't make sense because they don't use MVP right now.
[`CompositeAndroid`](https://github.com/passsy/CompositeAndroid) uses composition to add a `TiPresenter` to an `Activity`.
One line adds the `TiActivityPlugin` and everything works as expected.

```java
public class HelloWorldActivity extends CompositeActivity implements HelloWorldView {

    public HelloWorldActivity() {
    
        // Java 7
        addPlugin(new TiActivityPlugin<>(
                new TiPresenterProvider<HelloWorldPresenter>() {
                    @NonNull
                    @Override
                    public HelloWorldPresenter providePresenter() {
                        return new HelloWorldPresenter();
                    }
                }));

        // Java 8
        addPlugin(new TiActivityPlugin<HelloWorldPresenter, HelloWorldView>(
                () -> new HelloWorldPresenter()));
    }
}
```

Yes you have to extend `CompositeActivity`, but that's the last level of inheritance you'll ever need.
